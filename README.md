# Football-Passing-Networks

This paper explores how network science can enhance football outcome predictions by using passing network properties and performance indicators. We've developed two models: one treating players as nodes, and another using grid sections of the football field as nodes. Our approach offers a new angle on team organization and performance, previously overlooked in traditional analyses, and provides graphic visualizations to compare team dynamics effectively.
