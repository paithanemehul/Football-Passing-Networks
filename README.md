# Football Passing Networks Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies network science to football to predict match outcomes by analyzing passing networks. Using network summary measures, we developed two models: one considering players as nodes and another considering the football field divided into grids as nodes.

## Team Members
- Dinesh Adhithya - hdinesh18@iiserb.ac.in
- Kiran D - kiran18@iiserb.ac.in
- Rohit Taeja - rohit18@iiserb.ac.in

## Key Features
- **Passing Network Analysis:** Analyze the structure and dynamics of football passing using network science.
- **Performance Indicators:** Evaluate team performance using centrality measures and network properties.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning models to predict the probability of winning based on passing dynamics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statsbombpy for dataset handling
- Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest)
